# About MHS Unblocked Games

The team at MHS Unblocked Games is dedicated to unblocking games blocked by Fortinet's [FortiGuard.](https://www.fortiguard.com/webfilter) We are based in [Massey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massey,_New_Zealand) and work primarily for [Massey High School,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massey_High_School) updating our site accordingly to bypass any new games students request or any games which have received a recent block. In recent times, we have figured that we will have more freedom if we were to port our [old site](https://sites.google.com/view/mhsunblockedgames) to a Github repository, allowing to permanantly unblock games by keeping each game's assets on Github instead of using already prehosted assets, usually at risk of being either taken down or blocked by the web filter. We also now have the ability to hold games that require dependancies that Google does not support.


### Using our games library

Our games library can freely be reused and embed, some games may have issues surrounding being embed implemented by the games devolopers.
